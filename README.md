# Dactyl ManuForm Mini Keyboard (5x6)

This is a fork of the [Dactyl-ManuForm-Mini](https://github.com/bstiq/dactyl-manuform-mini-keyboard), by bstiq, which is a fork of the [Dactyl-ManuForm-Mini](https://github.com/l4u/dactyl-manuform-mini-keyboard). The Dactyl-Manuform-Mini is a fork of the [Dactyl-Manuform](https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard), which is a fork of the [Dactyl](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard) with the thumb cluster from [ManuForm](https://github.com/jeffgran/ManuForm).

This version are the 5x6 keyboard files, slightly modified so the inserted nut holders don't create bumps in the exterior of the piece. Be aware that laser cut plates from other versions won't fit this one.
